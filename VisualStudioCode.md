# Use of Visual Studio Code to program in PHP

## Visual Studio Code Config

To apply automatic format when you save the file, change the config editor.formatOnSave in your settings.json:

    "editor.formatOnSave": true

Now when you save the file it will format the file to you.

## Project Config

To use the phpcs and phpcbf in the project install in your composer.json the package "squizlabs/php_codesniffer" with the command:

    composer require --dev "squizlabs/php_codesniffer"

With that you can validate the quality of you code with phpcs and phpcbf with the extension PHP Sniffer

## Useful extensions

### PHP Sniffer

Reference: https://github.com/wongjn/vscode-php-sniffer

Configure settings.json:

    "phpSniffer.run": "onType",
    "phpSniffer.executablesFolder": "./vendor/bin/",
  
  
The onType to phpSniffer.run affect you when you are coding, you can see the error on syntax while you are coding without saving the code.

The config phpSniffer.executablesFolder to ./vendor/bin/ means that the extension will use the phpcs and phpcbf of your composer.json, it is better because your project has the phpcs inside the require dev packages.

This extension need the configuration of phpcs to work, the standard that I'm using is in [config-phpcs](config-phpcs/), then you need create in your project at least the file phpcs.xml, this file will describe the rules about your project and the PHP Sniffer extension will use it to notify you about the errors and fix the code for you.
